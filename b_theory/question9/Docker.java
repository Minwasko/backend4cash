    //todo A
    // What is a server?
    // Answer: a place where your code is constantly running

    //todo B
    // What is the difference between build server and production server?
    // Answer: production server is the one that normal users see when they access the site
    // build server is the one where all the coding and feature making happens

    //todo C
    // What is docker?
    // Answer: service that allows software to be run in "containers" where outside variables will not interfere

    //todo D
    // Name and explain docker container benefits over virtual machine setup (java jar as system process and installed nginx)
    // 1 docker containers occupy less space, since virtual machines require kernels
    // 2 less code to transfer, so docker is faster

    //todo E
    // Name and explain docker container drawback over virtual machine setup (java jar as system process and installed nginx)
    // 1 containers have limited Operating system resources compared to VM, who has access to all of them

    //todo F
    // Name and describe tools for docker architecture
    // 1 Docker Container, holds your running code
    // 2 Docker Daemon, does work with containers, for example run them

    //todo G
    // Name and explain why are companies slow in moving existing systems to docker architecture (do not explain why docker is bad)
    // 1 may take a lot of refactoring to make it work
    // 2 companies have working systems in place, so its cheaper for them to keep using them
