public class CI {

    //todo A
    // What is integration?
    // Answer: Merging code to mainline by different developers, so everyone is working on the same code

    //todo B
    // What makes integration continuous?
    // Answer: multiple developers work on code at the same time and make small commits that go through automated
    // testing, this ensures that everyone is working on the same code and code doesn't have any bugs

    //todo C
    // In the class we had 3 stages in our CI/CD process, tick [x] which ones stand for continuous integration
    // [x] compile
    // [x] test
    // [] deploy

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 benefit of CI
    // 1 code that developers are working on doesnt divert to much, this avoids possible errors when everyone pushes
    // their code

    //todo E
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of CI
    // 1 sometimes its hard to commit code with small changes

    //todo F
    // In the class we are using gitlab-ci. Name 2 alternatives to it
    // 1 gitlab has a very good UI
    // 2 gitlab allows multiple parallel gitlab runners
